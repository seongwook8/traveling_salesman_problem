# Travelling Salesman Problem
## What is the travelling salesman problem?
The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is the challenge of figuring out the shortest distance to connect all the vertices by visiting each point once and returning to the starting point. 

## About this Project
The following algorithms are explored and compared to solve the TSP problem
* Branch and Bound
* Nearest Neighbor
* 2-Opt Exchange
* Simulated Annealing
